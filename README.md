# Four-dimensional viro-therapy model

This code is used to obtain the bifurcation diagram of limit cycles for the model studied in Section 5 of the article "On a three-dimensional tumor-virus compartmental model, and two four-dimensional oncolytic virotherapy models".

To import the continuation data to Matlab, the files guologis.m and guologis.mat and the folder "guologis" must be saved in the subfolder "Systems" of the MATCONT folder.
